							Registration
						</h3>

						<p class="mb-8">
							In order to use this website, a user must first complete
							the registration form. During registration a user is
							required to give their full contact information. This
							information is used to evaluate the application and contact
							the user about the services on our site for which they have
							expressed interest. In order for this website to properly
							fulfill its obligation to our customers, it is necessary
							for us to supplement the information we receive with
							information from 3rd party sources. For example, to
							determine if our customers qualify for our service as an
							ISO, we use the name, driver's license, and social security
							number to request a credit report for use in evaluating the
							creditworthiness of the applicant.
						</p>

						<h3 class="font-bold text-black xl:text-lg mb-2">Order</h3>

						<p class="mb-8">
							We request information from consumers making purchases from
							our registered merchants within our shopping cart and order
							processing interfaces. Here a user must provide contact
							information (like name and shipping address), financial
							information (like credit card number, expiration date), and
							identity information (like social security number or
							Federal Tax ID). This information is used to fill
							customer's orders, for billing purposes, and to verify the
							identity of the consumer to protect against fraud. If we
							have trouble processing an order, this contact information
							is used to get in touch with the user.
						</p>

						<h3 class="font-bold text-black xl:text-lg mb-2">Cookies</h3>

						<p class="mb-8">
							A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive
							containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is
							in no way linked to any personally identifiable information
							while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the
							cookie simply terminates
						</p>

						<h3 class="font-bold text-black xl:text-lg mb-2">
							Log Files
						</h3>

						<p class="mb-8">
							We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site,
							track user's movement, and gather broad demographic
							information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked
							to personally identifiable information.
						</p>

						<h3 class="font-bold text-black xl:text-lg mb-2">Sharing</h3>

						<p class="mb-8">

							aware that we,Cornerstone Payment Systemsare not
							responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites.
							We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site
							and to read the privacy statements of each and every web
							site that collects personally identifiable information.
							This privacy statement applies solely to information
							collected by this Web site. Operators may be subject to the
							FTC's privacy regulations and if so, (i) the FTC's
							regulations contain sample disclosures that operators may
							consider; and (ii) operators may be required to send annual
							notices in addition to initial disclosures to their
							customers.
						</p>

						<h3 class="font-bold text-black xl:text-lg mb-2">Security</h3>

						<p>
							This website takes precautions to protect our users'
							information. When users submit sensitive information via
							the website, your information is protected both online and
							off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to
							enter sensitive information (such as credit card number,
							social security number, and/or Federal Tax ID), that
							information is encrypted and is protected with SSL
							encryption software. While on a secure page, such as our
							order form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers
							such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer
							becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you
							are just 'surfing'. While we use SSL encryption to protect
							sensitive information online, we also protect
							user-information off-line. All of our users' information,
							not just the sensitive information mentioned above, is
							restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the
							information to perform a specific job (for example, our
							billing clerk or a customer service representative) are
							granted access to personally identifiable information. Our
							employees must use password-protected screen-savers when
							they leave their desk. When they return, they must re-enter
							their password to re-gain access to your information.
							Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our
							security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as
							any time new policies are added, our employees are notified
							and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy,
							and what they can do to ensure our customers' information
							is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personally
							identifiable information on are kept in a secure
							environment, behind a locked door or cage.
						</p>

						<p>
							If you have any questions about the security at our
							website, you can send an email to info@cornerstone.cc Site
							and Service Updates <br /><br />

							We also send the user site and service announcement
							updates. We may close your account and/or refuse additional
							services if Members un-subscribe from service
							announcements, which contain important information about
							the service. We communicate with the user to provide
							requested services and in regards to issues relating to
							their account via email, fax, or phone. <br /><br />

							Correction/Updating Personal Information: If a user’s
							nonpublic personally identifiable information changes (such
							as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our
							service, we will endeavor to provide a way to correct,
							update or remove that user's personal data provided to us.
							This can usually be done by calling our headquarters
							at(888) 506-0208 or by emailing our Customer Support
							Department at info@cornerstone.cc for more instructions.
							<br /><br />

							Opt-out requirements: As provided in this policy, we only
							provide your nonpublic personal information to a
							nonaffiliated third party in conjunction with the services
							that you have requested that we provide to you. All
							nonaffiliated third parties to whom we disclose your
							nonpublic personal information are contractually prohibited
							by us to disclose or use the information other than to
							carry out the transactions that you have requested.
							Accordingly, there is nothing for a user to opt out of with
							respect to how we currently use their non-public personal
							information. <br /><br />

							Notification of Changes If we decide to change our privacy
							policy, we will post those changes on our Homepage so our
							users are always aware of what information we collect, how
							we use it, and under circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
							If at any point we decide to use personally identifiable
							information in a manner different from that stated at the
							time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an
							email or US mailing so as to enable users to "opt-out" if
							we use their information in this different manner. We will
							use information in accordance with the privacy policy under
							which the information was collected.
